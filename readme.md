# Multisite Auth

A multisite authentication plugin for handling logins, signups, password resets, activation account auth components all in one site

## About

Multisite Auth is a plugin you can use to handle all the authentication and account componenets under the same site/blog. You can create a custom blog for the authentication, say for instance `accounts.mynetwork.com`, and all the other sites and blogs (including the parent main one) will be redirected to this auth site to process the following:

- Account login
- Account logout
- Password reset and reset email
- User registrations with blogs
- Account activations

## Addons
